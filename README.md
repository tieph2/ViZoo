# ViZoo
Project Vision
A website with a Rust backend that utilizes free APIs to create data visualizations for animals.
I hope that on the final website, users will be able to look up any animal that they want to learn more about, otherwise the website will randomly pick an animal for them. The Rust back end will take care of making API calls and processes the data to give back to the front end to display.
